# Anomalies Detection on ECG Dataset Using LSTM/GRU Autoencoder
Extended version of "https://bit.ly/3O1z4hF". I enhanced the model-building functionality to allow for the creation of both LSTM and GRU Autoencoders, providing flexibility in model architecture selection. The system now supports customizable parameters, including the number of epochs and LSTM/GRU stages, enabling users to optimize model configuration based on the specific requirements of their task. Additionally, I implemented an AUC calculation function, facilitating performance comparisons between models and improving the process of selecting the best-performing model for each application
